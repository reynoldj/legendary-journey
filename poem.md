#Jabberwocky

__’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves__

__Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:__

__All mimsy were the borogoves,__

__And the mome raths outgrabe.__

*“Beware the Jabberwock, my son!* 

*The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!* 

*Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun*

*The frumious Bandersnatch!”*

__He took his vorpal sword in hand;__

__Long time the manxome foe he sought—__

__So rested he by the Tumtum tree__

__And stood awhile in thought.__

__And, as in uffish thought he stood,__

__The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,__

__Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,__

__And burbled as it came!__

One, two! One, two! And through and through 

The vorpal blade went snicker-snack! 

He left it dead, and with its head 

He went galumphing back. 

*“And hast thou slain the Jabberwock? 

Come to my arms, my beamish boy!* 

*O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!”*

He chortled in his joy. 

’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves 

Did gyre and gimble in the wabe: 

All mimsy were the borogoves, 

And the mome raths outgrabe.

-- _Lewis Caroll_
